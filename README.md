# ReaXstream
Universal VST plug-in & stand-alone application that works in tandem with ReaStreamMobile.
This suits allows you to transfer audio between device or applications as fast as possible.
The "ReaXstream" plug-in has a operation mode "ReaXstreamMobile" which is the mode of operation to work with the ["ReaStreamMobile"](https://github.com/JessyJP/ReaStreamMobile) app written entirely in MATLAB.
The prototype for this project is ["ReaStream-Standalone-Application"](https://github.com/JessyJP/ReaStream-Standalone-Application).

  + Supports Audio and +[Future TODO: MIDI] on for both transmission and reception.
  + Multiple modes and protocols of operation.
